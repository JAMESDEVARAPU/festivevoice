    "content": "Long ago, in the sacred hills of Tirumala, lived a great sage named Bhrigu Maharshi. Known for his wisdom, he once set out on a mission to test the Trimurthis – Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva, and Lord Vishnu – to decide who among them was the greatest.\n\nHe first visited Brahma, who was immersed in meditation and did not notice the sage. Feeling insulted, Bhrigu left for Mount Kailash to see Shiva. There, too, Lord Shiva was lost in deep union with Parvati, and again ignored the sage. Furious, Bhrigu cursed them both.\n\nAt last, he reached Vaikuntha — the abode of Lord Vishnu. Vishnu was resting, and again didn’t get up to receive Bhrigu. This time, Bhrigu was enraged beyond control and did something unthinkable — he kicked Lord Vishnu on His chest!\n\nBut instead of reacting with anger, Lord Vishnu gently got up, massaged the sage’s foot, and asked if he was hurt. He even apologized for not noticing the sage's arrival.\n\nAt that moment, Sage Bhrigu realized the depth of Lord Vishnu's humility and unconditional love. Overcome with guilt and devotion, he fell at the Lord's feet.\n\nIt is said that Lakshmi Devi, who resides in Vishnu's chest, was upset and left Vaikuntha, descending to Earth. To bring her back, Lord Vishnu incarnated as Lord Venkateshwara, settled on the Tirumala hills, and the divine couple reunited there.\n\n",

    "content": "Long ago, in a small village near Tirupati, lived a poor woman named Radha. She was a true devotee of Lord Venkateshwara, though she had very little to offer. Every day, she would save a handful of rice from her meager meals and put it aside as her offering to the Lord.\n\nOne day, she heard that a grand festival was to be celebrated at the temple. Devotees from across the land were donating gold, silver, and ghee to light thousands of lamps in the Lord’s sanctum.\n\nRadha felt sad. She had no wealth—only love in her heart. Still, she took the little oil she had saved for cooking and walked barefoot to the temple.\n\nAt the gate, the guards laughed at her offering. “What will one drop of oil do among thousands of lamps?” they mocked. But the temple priest, seeing the sincerity in her eyes, allowed her to pour her oil into a small clay lamp and place it at the far end of the sanctum.\n\nAs night fell, the temple lit up with thousands of flames. But when the wind blew, many lamps flickered and went out — all except one.\n\nRadha’s little lamp, lit with devotion, continued to burn brightly through the night.\n\nThe priests were amazed. They tried to extinguish it, but it wouldn’t go out. A voice echoed through the sanctum:\n\n“The Lord accepts devotion, not the size of the offering. Her love is eternal; so is her light.”",
