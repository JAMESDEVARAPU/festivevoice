    "content": "Long ago, in the sacred hills of Tirumala, lived a great sage named Bhrigu Maharshi. Known for his wisdom, he once set out on a mission to test the Trimurthis – Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva, and Lord Vishnu – to decide who among them was the greatest.\n\nHe first visited Brahma, who was immersed in meditation and did not notice the sage. Feeling insulted, Bhrigu left for Mount Kailash to see Shiva. There, too, Lord Shiva was lost in deep union with Parvati, and again ignored the sage. Furious, Bhrigu cursed them both.\n\nAt last, he reached Vaikuntha — the abode of Lord Vishnu. Vishnu was resting, and again didn’t get up to receive Bhrigu. This time, Bhrigu was enraged beyond control and did something unthinkable — he kicked Lord Vishnu on His chest!\n\nBut instead of reacting with anger, Lord Vishnu gently got up, massaged the sage’s foot, and asked if he was hurt. He even apologized for not noticing the sage's arrival.\n\nAt that moment, Sage Bhrigu realized the depth of Lord Vishnu's humility and unconditional love. Overcome with guilt and devotion, he fell at the Lord's feet.\n\nIt is said that Lakshmi Devi, who resides in Vishnu's chest, was upset and left Vaikuntha, descending to Earth. To bring her back, Lord Vishnu incarnated as Lord Venkateshwara, settled on the Tirumala hills, and the divine couple reunited there.\n\n",
