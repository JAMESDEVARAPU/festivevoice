Viswam.ai - Summer of AI Internship 2025: Intern Instructions

Welcome to the Summer of AI 2025! This document outlines the core tasks, learning path, and goals for your internship. Our mission is to build Indic datasets to fine-tune AI models, and your contribution is crucial. Let's get started.

Primary Goals:


Corpus Collection: With the Minimum target of 80 hours of Audio & Video and 800 records of Images & Text per Intern, directlty sourced from the human. This is the major step in building your AI project, from model finetuning to scaling to multi-usecase applications.

Build Colloborative Corpus Collection AI Engine Projects
Build the fine-tuned LLMs

More is always good; more quality data => better fine-tuned models.
Recommended: 20 hours of Audio & Video and 200 records of Images & Text per Intern per week.
Your most important ongoing task is the daily collection of high-quality corpus data. This data is the foundation for the AI models we will build and refine. Consistency is key to achieving our collective goal.

Corpus Collection Guidelines

This is the application used to build Indic datasets for fine-tuning AI models. You can contribute using the following platforms:


Web App: Access the corpus collection tool at corpus.swecha.org. It is designed to work on all devices, including desktops and mobiles.

1. Onboarding and Setup

Complete these initial steps to get fully integrated into our ecosystem.

1.1 Account Creation & Platform Onboarding

You will use a single sign-on (SSO) approach. Your account on code.swecha.org will be your primary identity.


Create Your Primary Account:

Go to code.swecha.org (our GitLab instance) and register for an account. This will be your main login for other services.
For all the project activities, including from ideation, planning and code docntributions goes here.



Log in to Essential Platforms (using your code.swecha.org account):


chat.swecha.org: Our Mattermost instance for all team communication.

1.2 Create Your Profile README

Your code.swecha.org profile README will serve as your professional portfolio and a new-age resume. It's a public showcase of your skills, projects, and contributions.


Action: Create a file named README.md in a new public repository under your username.

Content: Introduce yourself, list your skills, link to your projects, and detail your contributions.

Maintenance: Update it regularly throughout the internship as you acquire new skills and complete project milestones. This will be a valuable asset for your future opportunities.


1.3 Complete your Development Environment Setup

Check Initial Development Environment Setup for detailes instructions.

2. Learning Path & Project Development

This section details the skills you will learn and the projects you will build.

2.1 Prompt Engineering, AI Fundamentals, Python & Building an Open Source AI Assistant



Learn Prompt Engineering: Understand the art and science of crafting effective prompts.

Learn how to engineer prompts with classifying tasks, context, format, examples and others.
Master concepts like System Prompts and creating distinct AI Personas.


Know about Tokens and context window, RAG, In-context learning, LLM Benchmarks, open weights, Inferencing, Fine-tuning, Model Training

Learn App Development: Use Python and the Streamlit library to build interactive web applications for data science and AI.

Build an AI Assistant: Apply your prompt engineering skills to create a useful, open-source AI assistant. Follow detailed submission guidelines



2.2 Collaborative AI App Development with Python



Build a Team Project: Collaborate with fellow interns to develop a fully functional, AI-powered application. Follow detailed Submission Guidelines



2.3 Advanced AI: Inferencing and Fine-Tuning



Learn Model Inferencing: Get hands-on experience running AI models locally.


On PCs: Use Ollama to run and interact with various large language models.

On Mobile: Explore Pocketpal for on-device AI model inferencing.



Fine-tune AI Models: Fine-tune an AI model on the data you've created. A team of 5 can prepare unique Indic datasets to train AI models in Indic languages.

Attain Compute Power: Fine-tuning requires significant computational resources. You will learn about and participate in building distributed compute grids by signing up fellow interns for volunteer computing initiatives.


2.4 Evaluation and Benchmarking of AI models



Model Assessment: Perform a thorough evaluation and benchmarking of your fine-tuned model to measure its performance and accuracy. Once complete, submit your model and results for evaluation.
